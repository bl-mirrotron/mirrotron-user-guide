# The Mirrotron RFQ Control System
## Overview
The Mirrotron Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) is part of a compact neutron source that is being built in Martonvásár Hungary. The compact neutron source consists of five major systems
* 35 keV Hydrogen Ion source
* 2.5 MeV RFQ
* 200 MHz RF power amplifier
* Lithium Target station
* Neutron Instrument stations

The 2.5 MeV RFQ designed and built by Time Co, Ltd., Japan is a pulsed accelerator that can support 1.25 mS pulses at a rate of 40 Hz for a maximum duty factor of 5% . The RFQ can accelerate a peak beam current of 20 mA with an input RF power 260 kW at 200 MHz. providing an average beam power of 2.5 kW. The loaded cavity Q is 10,000 which results in a cavity bandwidth of 20 kHz.

The RFQ accelerator system can be divided into 4 major subsystems
* [RF source (LLRF)](LLRF.md)
* Timing system
* Vacuum system
* Cooling system
